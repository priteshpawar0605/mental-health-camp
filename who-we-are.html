    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      We are a passionate team dedicated to promoting teenage mental wellness. Our mission is to create a safe space
      where teenagers can share their stories, support each other, and feel heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team includes psychology students, educators, and volunteers who care deeply about mental health and want to
      make a real difference. We believe in the power of community and conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At MindSpace Teens, every voice matters. We’re committed to building a supportive, understanding, and non-judgmental
      environment where no one feels alone.
